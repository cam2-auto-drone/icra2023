    <h2> Call for Papers </h2>
    <p>
      We invite the submission of extended abstracts, papers, and simulation/demonstration summaries. Submission that include experimental results in simulation and/or with real robots are particularly of interest. Papers with descriptions of work in progress or preliminary experimental results are also welcome to be submitted. We do not encourage papers with only proof of concept and no simulations/experiments. Submissions should adhere to the ICRA standard pdf format and be maximum 4 pages. Accepted papers will be made available on the workshop website, and authors will be invited to present their paper during the workshop.

Topics of interest to this workshop include, but are not necessarily limited to: <br>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Aerial Traffic Management</b></li> 
            <ul>
<li>Multi-Agent Fleet Management</li>
<li>Obstacle Detection and Avoidance</li>
