<h3> Safe Navigation for Aerial Robotics: From Simulation to Deployment</h3>

    <p>
 Aerial robotics is increasingly gaining more attention as it gives rise to new possibilities in a wide range of applications 
        such as package delivery, wildlife monitoring, and disaster management. However, the science and technology behind such 
        systems have yet to catch up with the expectations of their efficiency, safety, reliability, and agility. 
        This workshop aims to set up a nexus of ideas on safe navigation for aerial robotics, create a unified understanding 
        of the current and future challenges, and build dialogue among different communities to spark new interdisciplinary research. 
        The workshop brings together expert researchers and practitioners working on diverse aspects of aerial robotics, including, 
        path planning, perception, robust control, agile maneuvering, online adaptation, and multi-agent systems, from simulation to deployment.

    </p>
    <p>
 We believe that future employment of robotics in various applications will significantly impact our lives, reducing production-related 
        risks for humans, preventing and reacting to emergencies, and assisting in common tasks of everyday life. Among the several robotics 
        fields, aerial robotics represents an emerging, promising, and one of the most rapidly growing topics. Aerial robots, also called 
        Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), can reach hardly accessible areas and operate above rough terrains while enjoying a select point of 
        view over the surroundings. Several application fields exploit aerial robot characteristics to improve our quality of life, safety, and 
        efficiency. In the case of precision agriculture, we can employ aerial robots to monitor and analyze crops from an elect point of view 
        and to act when and only when required with crop dusting and spraying, eventually boosting the yield of a field while reducing the amount 
        of chemicals needed. In industrial scenarios, we use aerial robots to monitor, inspect, and intervene in hardly accessible or hazardous 
        areas of factories, oil channels, power lines, and towers. Industries are developing several environmental applications to monitor the 
        effects of climate change, to help preserve wildlife and ecosystems (e.g., automatically estimating the population in a species), and 
        to identify issues and gather data for their solution. Similar strategies can be employed to scan civil infrastructures such as railways, 
        highways, dams, and bridges, not only to perform daily maintenance but also to identify crucial issues and prevent disasters. Finally, aerial 
        robots will also appear in everyday life. They will be helpful in assisting the elderly and guiding them in unknown places. 
  </p>
          <p>
This workshop focuses on challenges and advancements in the field of aerial robotics. It provides a forum for researchers to publish and 
              present their work that has leveraged simulations in the eventual deployment of aerial robots. Some key research topics of 
              interest include the study of complex aggregations of autonomous robots, e.g., multiple heterogeneous systems or multi-agent 
              UAV fleets. The workshop will also focus on techniques for designing novel ways to let humans co-operate with complex semi-autonomous 
              systems, safe aerial robot autonomy, onboard sensing & computation in indoor and outdoor environments, and interaction between robots 
              and nearby surroundings.
